Learn Aid is a mobile application designed to connect individuals who have a passion for teaching and doing social good to NGOs and orphanages where children aged between 6-14 years require tutoring services. The app provides a platform for mentors to register and search for NGOs where they can offer their services. At the same time, the NGOs can register and search for mentors who can help them with specific subjects and classes.

The app is built using Flutter, a popular mobile app development framework, and the data is stored using Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL document database. The app features email authentication using Google Firebase, ensuring that only verified users can access the platform. 

The app has many other functionalities, including a search feature that allows users to find NGOs and mentors quickly, and enables communication between mentors and NGOs directly through email and phone. The app also has the feature of Aadhar verification for the mentors for further verification.

Learn Aid is an innovative solution that addresses the issue of the lack of educational support for children in orphanages and NGOs. By connecting mentors with these organizations, it provides children with access to quality education, which is essential for their growth and development. The app also provides mentors with an opportunity to contribute to society by using their skills and knowledge to teach children who are in need of educational support.

The app's structure is straightforward, with three main user roles: mentors, NGOs, and administrators. Mentors can create profiles highlighting their skills and experience, search for NGOs that need their services, and communicate with them via the in-app messaging system. NGOs, on the other hand, can create profiles that highlight the specific needs of their organization, search for mentors who can provide the necessary tutoring services, and communicate with them via the app's messaging system. Administrators have access to all user accounts and can manage the app's functionality and features.

The app's utility is vast, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way tutoring services are provided to children in need. The app's primary focus is on children aged between 6-14 years, a critical age group that requires a solid foundation in various subjects to succeed in life. Learn Aid provides a platform that can connect these children with passionate mentors who can help them achieve their goals.

In terms of future scope, Learn Aid can add several features to enhance the app's functionality and user experience. For example, the app can include a feature that allows mentors to track their progress and the progress of the children they are tutoring. The app can also add a feature that allows NGOs to generate reports on the impact of the tutoring services they receive. Finally, Learn Aid can expand its user base beyond NGOs and orphanages and include schools and other organizations that require tutoring services.

In conclusion, Learn Aid is an innovative and useful app that addresses the issue of educational support for children in orphanages and NGOs. By connecting mentors with these organizations, it provides children with access to quality education, while also providing mentors with an opportunity to contribute to society. The app has immense potential for expansion and can be a game-changer in the field of social development.
